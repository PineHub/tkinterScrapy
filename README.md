This is a scrapy-based web crawler with a GUI.
You enter the website name, the keyword, the number of pages to search, and whether you want Depth-First or Breadth-First Search.
Then it will crawl the website of choice for the word, then it will search links from that site if it can't find it, search those links for the keyword, and so on with a turtle-based visualizer that reacts to the links searched.
Once the maximum number of pages are reached or the keyword is found, the program will let you know if the word as found or not.
